  <h2>Welcome</h2>
  <p>
    BCS is a community-driven NGO working in townships and rural areas around Bloemfontein.
    Our aim is to fight poverty, reduce food insecurity, and improve education outcomes for children.
  </p>

  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p>
    The organisation was started by local volunteers who saw the struggles faced by families in the community.
    Many households lacked access to proper schooling, regular meals, and opportunities for growth.
    Over time, BCS developed programmes that directly address these needs through education support,
    food security projects, and community development initiatives.
  </p>

  <h2>Our Programmes</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Education Programmes: Tutoring, workshops, and school supplies for children aged 5–18.</li>
    <li>Food Security Initiatives: Food distribution and community gardens to reduce hunger.</li>
    <li>Community Development: Skills training and workshops to build local capacity.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Target Audience</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Children (5–18 years) needing education support</li>
    <li>Families struggling with food insecurity</li>
    <li>Community members looking for skills development opportunities</li>
  </ul>
