  <h2>Background & History</h2>
  <p>
    Bloemfontein Community Support (BCS) was founded by a group of dedicated local volunteers
    who saw the urgent need to uplift underprivileged communities in Bloemfontein, South Africa. 
    Many families in the area faced challenges such as poverty, limited access to education, 
    and food insecurity, which negatively affected children’s learning outcomes and overall well-being.
  </p>
  <p>
    Over the years, BCS has grown into a trusted non-profit organisation working hand in hand with
    schools, clinics, and community leaders to provide practical solutions. Our work includes 
    food distribution programmes, community gardens, tutoring, and skills development initiatives.
    By promoting sustainability and empowerment, we aim to break the cycle of poverty and give 
    families the tools they need to thrive.
  </p>
  <p>
    Today, BCS continues to focus on three main areas: 
    <strong>Education Support</strong>, <strong>Food Security</strong>, and <strong>Community Development</strong>.
    With a strong team of volunteers and local partnerships, we are making a tangible impact in the lives 
    of children and families across townships and rural communities in and around Bloemfontein.
  </p>

  <h2>Mission</h2>
  <p>
    To empower underprivileged communities in Bloemfontein through education initiatives, 
    food security programmes, and community development — enhancing quality of life and 
    promoting sustainable change.
  </p>

  <h2>Vision</h2>
  <p>
    Thriving, resilient communities where children succeed in education, families are food secure, 
    and residents have the skills and opportunities to build a brighter future.
