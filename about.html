  <h2>Background & History</h2>
  <p>
    Bloemfontein Community Support (BCS) was officially founded on 05 August 2025 
    by a group of dedicated local volunteers who saw the urgent need to uplift underprivileged communities 
    in Bloemfontein, South Africa. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Over the years, BCS has grown into a trusted non-profit organisation working hand in hand with
    schools, clinics, and community leaders to provide practical solutions. Our work includes 
    food distribution programmes, community gardens, tutoring, and skills development initiatives.
    By promoting sustainability and empowerment, we aim to break the cycle of poverty and give 
    families the tools they need to thrive.
  </p>
  <p>
    Today, BCS continues to focus on the three main areas: 
    Education Support, Food Security, and Community Development.
    With a strong team of volunteers and local partnerships, we are making a tangible impact in the lives 
    of children and families across townships and rural communities in and around Bloemfontein.
  </p>
